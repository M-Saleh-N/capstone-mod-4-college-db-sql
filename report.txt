Capstone Project 2: College Database Design and Queries
--------------------------------------------------------

👨‍🎓 Schema Design Overview
----------------------------
This project implements a normalized relational database for a fictional college. The schema is designed to follow 3NF (Third Normal Form) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Tables Created:
1. students     - stores basic student information
2. instructors  - stores instructor details and links to departments
3. departments  - stores academic department names
4. courses      - each course is taught by an instructor and belongs to a department
5. enrollments  - many-to-many relationship between students and courses, with optional grade

Normalization Highlights:
- Each table has a single theme and a primary key
- No repeating groups or derived data
- Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables
- All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key

🧠 Query Summary
----------------------------
10 queries were created to demonstrate understanding of SQL concepts like:

1. INNER JOIN to list students and their courses
2. LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY to count enrollments per course
3. CASE + AVG for grade point calculation
4. Subquery to find students not enrolled in any course
5. EXISTS and IN for filtering
6. Aggregation for top performers
7. Filtering by department
8. HAVING clause for course popularity
9. JOINs to get department-course relationships
10. Identifying unused courses via NULL LEFT JOINs

Example Result:
- Query #3 shows the average grade (as GPA points) for each course.
- Query #8 ranks students by how many courses they are taking.

🧾 Deliverables Implemented
----------------------------
✔️ schema.sql - all CREATE TABLE statements  
✔️ data.sql - 10+ entries per table  
✔️ queries.sql - 10 fully working and commented SQL queries  
✔️ report.txt - explanation of schema and query insights  
✔️ README.md - instructions to run and understand the project

✅ The database is self-contained and ready for testing or extension.
